        <h2>Well Left, Mitchell</h2>
        <P>Today new writer William Buckingham discusses one of the most extraordinary events to occur on a cricket field in living memory. And we’re not talking about Ben Stokes’s heroics at Headingley or Kusal Perera’s miracle at Durban …
            During this period of lockdown I have, inevitably, watched the 2019 Cricket World Cup Final a fair few times. It will always be remembered as an extraordinary game. But there’s one moment that never ceases to amaze me. No, not the deflection off Ben Stokes’ bat (although that was rather unbelievable), but the last ball of New Zealand’s innings.</P>

        <p>New Zealand, placed on 241/8, had Mitchell Santner facing up to Jofra Archer for the final ball of the innings. What was Santner’s plan? One would assume it would be to swing and hope for a boundary, or at least get ‘bat on ball’. After all, the last ball of an innings is like a free hit.
            Instead, quite unbelievably, Santner ducked beneath Archer’s slower ball bouncer. I REPEAT, MITCHELL SANTNER LEFT THE LAST BALL OF NEW ZEALAND’S INNINGS.At the time it didn’t seem like a significant moment. But knowing the events that followed, and how vital every single run would turn out to be, only heightens the madness of this boneheaded decision. Imagine how the course of history might’ve changed if Santner had bothered to throw bat at ball in anger.</p>
